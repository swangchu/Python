# Program Number 2:
# A ball is dropped from a tower of height h. 
# It has initial velocity zero and accelerates downwards under gravity. 
# Write a program that asks the user to enter the height in meters of the tower and a time interval t in seconds, 
# then prints on the screen the height of the ball above the ground at time t after it is dropped, ignoring air resistance. 
# If the height of the ball is zero then print the ball hit the ground.
