# Python

This is a collection of programs written in python for my students. I have tried whereever possible to
integrate in their subject of interest. 

For an example, program number 1 is to calculate the force. This program was assigned to science students.
Thus solidifying the concepts learn in physics while coding in Python. Also to show to them, how coding
can help in solving problem and automating boring things.

I will keep updating as I assign to my students.
